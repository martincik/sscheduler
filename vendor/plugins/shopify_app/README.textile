h2. Shopify application generator

h3. Description:

This plugin adds access to Shopify's powerful API to your rails application. 
    
The generator creates a basic login controller for authenticating with your
Shop and a controller called "home" which displays basic information 
about your products, orders and articles.
    
bq. _Note:_ It's recommended to use this on a new Rails project, so that the 
generator won't overwrite/delete some of your files.

h3. Installation:

bq. @gem install shopify_api@

bq. @script/plugin install git://github.com/Shopify/shopify_app@

h3. Usage:

Pass your API key and then your Secret, which the login controller 
will need to authenticate with your shop.

If you don't have an API key yet, register your application at: "YourShopURL/admin/api":#

(e.g. "http://yourshopname.myshopify.com/admin/api":#)

    
h3. Example:

@script/generate shopify_app edffbb1bb793e2750686e6f4647a384a fed5bb18hde3e2750686e6f4647a781a@
        
This will create a login controller and a home controller with their own views.

h3. After running the generator:

# Run your application with @script/server@
# And visit "http://localhost:3000":http://localhost:3000 and you are ready to log in with your Shopify account.
